Spark Erosion Circuit Boards

Some people on the internet already had the idea, but a quick search brings up no results of a working machine that gives you a circuit board. This project shall have a working PCB producing machine as an outcome.

## Spark Erosion
> Electrical discharge machining (EDM), sometimes colloquially also referred to as spark machining, spark eroding, burning, die sinking, wire burning or wire erosion, is a manufacturing process whereby a desired shape is obtained by using electrical discharges (sparks).

## Circuit Baords
> A printed circuit board (PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate.
